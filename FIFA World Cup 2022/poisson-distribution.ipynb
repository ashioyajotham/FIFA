It is commonly used in modeling the number of times an event occurs in a given time period, such as the number of customers arriving at a store or the number of calls received by a call center.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## How to fit a Poisson Distribution\n\n* To create a Poisson distribution machine learning model, you would first need to collect data on the number of times the event you are interested in has occurred over a set of fixed time intervals. You can then use this data to fit a Poisson distribution to the data and use the resulting model to make predictions about the probability of the event occurring in future time intervals.\n\n* One way to fit a Poisson distribution to data is to use `Maximum Likelihood stimation` (MLE). This involves finding the values of the parameters of the Poisson distribution that maximize the likelihood of the data given the distribution. Once the model has been fit to the data, you can use it to make predictions by plugging in values for the time interval and any other relevant factors (such as the number of customers arriving at a store) and calculating the probability of the event occurring.\n\n* It is important to note that the Poisson distribution is only appropriate for modeling events that occur independently of one another and that have a constant rate of occurrence over time. If these conditions are not met, a different statistical distribution may be more appropriate.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Example","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nfrom scipy.stats import poisson\n\n# Sample data\ndata = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]\n\n# Fit a Poisson distribution to the data using MLE\nmu = np.mean(data)\nmodel = poisson(mu)\n\n# Make predictions for future time intervals\npredictions = model.pmf(range(30))\n\n# Print the predictions\nprint(predictions)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-12-06T15:37:39.206638Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-12-06T15:37:39.206988Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-12-06T15:37:40.133250Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-12-06T15:37:39.206896Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-12-06T15:37:40.131828Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"[3.05902321e-07 4.58853481e-06 3.44140111e-05 1.72070055e-04\n 6.45262707e-04 1.93578812e-03 4.83947030e-03 1.03702935e-02\n 1.94443003e-02 3.24071672e-02 4.86107508e-02 6.62873875e-02\n 8.28592344e-02 9.56068089e-02 1.02435867e-01 1.02435867e-01\n 9.60336250e-02 8.47355515e-02 7.06129596e-02 5.57470733e-02\n 4.18103050e-02 2.98645036e-02 2.03621615e-02 1.32796706e-02\n 8.29979410e-03 4.97987646e-03 2.87300565e-03 1.59611425e-03\n 8.55061205e-04 4.42273037e-04]\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## ** FYI, this content has been generated by `ChatGPT` **","metadata":{}}]}

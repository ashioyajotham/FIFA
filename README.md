# FIFA
An EDA of FIFA games (both real world and video).


## [FIFA World Cup 2022](https://github.com/ashioyajotham/FIFA/tree/main/FIFA%20World%20Cup%202022)
* The data used was scrapped from [Wikipedia](https://web.archive.org/web/20221115040351/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup) using    _BeautifulSoup_ and _Selenium_ in three parts;

            - Dictionary tables of table groups of the teams
            
            - Historical data from 1930 to 2018
            
            - 2022 Match fixtures
            
            
     
* Applied **Poisson Distribution** for the predictive modelling


* The interesting bit is that an [Oxford math model also predicted Brazil as the winner](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/oxforduni_worldcup-activity-6999329112980914177-9WA2)
